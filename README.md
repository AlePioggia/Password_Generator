# Password_Generator
This project contains 3 very simple python scripts that I wrote from scratch,
it will help you to generate passwords on a text file of the current directory.
NOTE : everytime you will run the script, the file password.txt WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.


single_password_generator.py :
        In this one only one password will be generated.(password length 30 chars)

multiple_password_generator.py:
        In this one 10 password will be generated.(single password length 30 chars)

multiple_password_generator_range.py:
        In this one you will decide how many passwords generate(you will also decide the password length!!!)

INSTRUCTIONS TO USE:
        In case you didn't know:
                - Download python3
                - Open terminal
                - Go to directory where the project is stored
                - type python3 <script_name>
                - HAVE FUN!
